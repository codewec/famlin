# Maintenance

## Backups

Two things need backing up:

- **`famlin-db-data`** (Docker volume) — the Postgres database: users, groups, posts, comments, settings.
- **`famlin-uploads`** (Docker volume) — uploaded photos.

Both are named volumes declared in `docker-compose.yml`. Find their host paths with:

```bash
docker volume inspect famlin_famlin-db-data famlin_famlin-uploads
```

(the `famlin_` prefix is the Compose project name, usually derived from the directory the compose file lives in). Include both paths in your existing backup routine — on a Synology NAS this typically means pointing Hyper Backup or a scheduled `rsync` task at the Docker data folder that contains them.

A simple logical backup of just the database can also be taken with `pg_dump`:

```bash
docker compose exec famlin-db pg_dump -U famlin famlin > famlin-backup.sql
```

### Restoring from a data export

The admin UI's **Data export** (Server settings → General) is a second, independent kind of backup: one zip holding every family's content and every uploaded photo/video, which you can restore onto a **new, empty** Famlin server — handy when moving hosts (NAS to VPS, off a dying machine) or when the database volume itself is what got corrupted. It doesn't need the old server to still be running, and it doesn't need shell access on either end.

1. Start the new server as usual (see [Server setup](./server-setup)), running the **same or a newer** Famlin version than the one that made the export — an export from a newer version is refused.
2. Open `/admin`. A fresh server shows the first-run setup screen; choose **Restore a backup**.
3. Pick the export zip and enter the email, name and password for your admin login. If the backup already has an account with that email, that account becomes an admin and gets this password (so it stays linked to everything you posted); otherwise a new admin account is created next to the restored ones.
4. Wait for the upload and restore to finish — for a large photo library this takes a while.

Restoring only works while the server has **no accounts at all**: it never merges into a server that's already in use, and it's refused once anyone has signed up.

**What a restore does not bring back.** The export deliberately leaves out credentials and server configuration, so after restoring:

- **Nobody else can sign in yet.** Passwords are never exported. Reconfigure OIDC/SSO under Server settings (members then sign in exactly as before, matched by email), and/or reset password-login members' passwords from the **Users** page.
- **Server settings are blank** — OIDC, allowed emails, SMTP, Immich/local media connections, store links. Set them up again. Linked albums and people mappings *are* restored, and start working again once the media source is reconfigured with the same albums.
- **Invite links, push tokens and API tokens are gone.** Create new invites as needed; the apps re-register for push on next sign-in; members recreate their API tokens.
- **Every previous session is signed out**, including on devices that were logged in to the old server.
- Notification history and the push delivery log start empty.

Treat the export as a complement to the volume backups above, not a replacement: volumes restore *everything*, including settings and passwords; the export is the one you can restore without them.

## Updating

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The backend container re-runs `prisma migrate deploy` on every start, so pending schema migrations are applied automatically — there's no separate migration step to remember.

When stopped or updated, the backend finishes requests already in progress (an upload mid-write, say) for up to 30 seconds (`stop_grace_period` in `docker-compose.yml`) before it exits.

**Keep your `docker-compose.yml` up to date too.** `pull` only updates the image, not your copy of the compose file. Releases occasionally improve the compose file itself (for example the backend healthcheck, log rotation and shutdown grace period). Compare yours against the [repository's `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/TimVanOnckelen/famlin/blob/main/docker-compose.yml), or the one attached to each release, after updating.

If you pinned `FAMLIN_VERSION` in `.env` (see below), bump it before pulling so you get the version you expect rather than a moved `latest` tag.

If you're [building from source](#building-from-source-instead) instead of running the pre-built image, update with `git pull && docker compose up -d --build` instead.

## Staying up to date

The admin dashboard (`/admin`) checks the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/timvanonckelen/famlin/releases) for the running server's version and shows a banner — "A new version is available" with a link to that release's notes — whenever a newer version has shipped than the one you're running. No configuration needed; it's a one-shot, fail-soft check (no notice at all if GitHub is unreachable or rate-limited).

If you'd rather be notified outside the admin UI, "Watch" the repository's releases on GitHub (**Watch → Custom → Releases** on the [repo page](https://github.com/timvanonckelen/famlin)) to get an email/notification per release.

### Automating updates with Watchtower

For a fully hands-off setup, [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) can pull and restart `famlin-backend` whenever a new image is published. Scope it to just that container so your database and other services aren't touched:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
watchtower:
  image: containrrr/watchtower
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  command: --interval 3600 famlin-backend
  restart: unless-stopped
```

Since schema migrations run automatically on start (see above), an unattended update also means unattended migrations. That's usually fine, but a breaking change would apply itself before you've had a chance to read the release notes — if you'd rather review [breaking changes](https://github.com/timvanonckelen/famlin/releases) first, stick to the manual `pull`/`up -d` flow above, or pin `FAMLIN_VERSION` and bump it deliberately instead of running Watchtower against `latest`.

## Pinning a version

`docker-compose.yml` runs the pre-built image published to `ghcr.io/timvanonckelen/famlin` on every tagged release (e.g. `ghcr.io/timvanonckelen/famlin:1.2.0`, plus a rolling `latest`). By default it tracks `latest`; set `FAMLIN_VERSION` in `.env` to pin a specific version instead, so updates are a deliberate, reviewed step:

```bash title=".env"
FAMLIN_VERSION=1.2.0
```

Bump it and run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` when you're ready to update.

## Building from source instead

If you'd rather build the backend image yourself (e.g. you're running a fork, or testing an unreleased change) instead of pulling from `ghcr.io`, replace the `image:` line for `famlin-backend` in your compose file with a `build:` block:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
famlin-backend:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: backend/Dockerfile
  # remove the `image:` line
```

The build context must be the **repository root**, not `backend/` — the image also bundles the member-facing web app (`web/` and `packages/`), which live outside `backend/`. You'll need a full checkout of the repository alongside your compose file for this. Update with `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

## Using an external database

If you'd rather run Postgres outside of Compose (a managed database, an existing Postgres instance on the NAS, etc.), remove the `famlin-db` service from your compose file (or override it to a no-op) and point `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` at your instance:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/famlin?schema=public
```

Make sure the database and user already exist — Famlin does not create the database itself, only the schema inside it (via `prisma migrate deploy` on startup).

## Troubleshooting

**Containers won't start / `JWT_SECRET is required`** — `docker-compose.yml` fails fast if `JWT_SECRET` isn't set. Confirm `.env` is in the same directory you run `docker compose` from.

**`famlin-backend` shows as `unhealthy`** — its healthcheck calls `GET /health`, which returns `503` when the database is unreachable or the uploads volume isn't writable. The reason is logged: run `docker compose logs famlin-backend` and look for `health check failed`. Check that `famlin-db` is running and healthy, and that the disk holding the `famlin-uploads` volume isn't full or mounted read-only.

**Migrations fail on startup** — check `docker compose logs famlin-backend`. This usually means the `famlin-db` container isn't reachable yet or `DATABASE_URL` doesn't match its credentials.

**Uploaded photos disappear after a redeploy** — this means the `famlin-uploads` volume isn't being reused, usually because the compose project name changed (e.g. running from a different directory) or `-v` / `down -v` was used, which removes volumes. Avoid `docker compose down -v` in production; use plain `down` (or just `up -d --build` for updates, no `down` needed at all).

**Family members get "Network Error" when posting photos or videos** — the upload was cut off before it finished. If nothing about the upload appears in `docker compose logs famlin-backend`, the request never reached Famlin, so the reverse proxy rejected it: raise its request body limit (Nginx's default is 1 MB) and its read/send timeouts — see [Put a reverse proxy in front](./server-setup#4-put-a-reverse-proxy-in-front). Famlin's own per-file limit is 200 MB, and a file over it answers with a clear "file too large" message instead.

**Can't reach `/admin` through the reverse proxy but the container works on `localhost:3000`** — check that the proxy forwards the full path (not just `/`) and doesn't strip the `/admin` prefix.
